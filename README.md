## Heart Disease Predictions
*Building a machine learning model that can succesfully predict wheather an individual is at risk of heart disease using classification. I will be using data from kaggle which can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/version/1?select=heart.csv *
***

## Project Objectives

- Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook report.


- Create modules (wrangle.py) that make my process repeateable.


- Construct a model to predict heart disease using classification techniques.



## Goals
- Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.


- Document your process well enough to be presented or read like a report.

- Make a presentation to report my findings
***


## Deliverables

I expect to deliver the following:

- a Jupyter Notebook Report showing process and analysis with the goal of finding which features most accuratley represent risk for heart disease. This notebook should be commented and documented well enough to be read like a report or walked through as a presentation.


- a README.md file containing the project description with goals, initial hypotheses, a data dictionary, project planning, instructions or an explanation of how someone else can recreate my project and findings (What would someone need to be able to recreate my project on their own?), answers to my hypotheses, key findings, recommendations, and takeaways from my project.
    


- individual modules, .py files, that hold my functions to acquire and prepare my data.
***

## Project Planning
**Plan->** Acquire -> Prepare -> Explore -> Model & Evaluate -> Deliver

- Create Readme.md that describes the project and goals.


- Create an wrangle.py file to acquire the heart data set, prepare and select my features and split it into  train validate and test dataframes.  


- Create and update a data dictionary for those reading the project


- Document my project in a way that passes the wife test (can my wife who isnt into data science understand what is happening)


- Clearly state my starting hypotheses (and add the testing of these to my task list).

## Data Acquisition

Plan -> **Acquire** -> Prepare -> Explore -> Model & Evaluate -> Deliver

Make an acquire.py module that:

Stores functions that are needed to acquire data from kaggle; make sure my module contains the necessary imports to run my code. 

My final function will return a pandas DataFrame.

## Data Preparation

Plan -> Acquire -> **Prepare** -> Explore -> Model & Evaluate -> Deliver



Store functions that are needed to prepare my data
My final function should do the following:

- Split my data into train/validate/test.

- Handle Missing Values.

- Handle erroneous data and/or outliers I wish to address.

- Encode variables as needed.

Store it to a well documented wrangle.py

## Data Exploration & Analysis

Plan -> Acquire -> Prepare -> **Explore** -> Model & Evaluate -> Deliver

###### Hypothesis 1
${H}_{0}$ 

${H}_{a}$ 

###### Hypothesis 2
${H}_{0}$ 

${H}_{a}$ 

###### Hypothesis 3
${H}_{0}$ 

${H}_{a}$ 

###### Hypothesis 4
${H}_{0}$ 

${H}_{a}$ 

###### Hypothesis 5
${H}_{0}$ 

${H}_{a}$  

###### Hypothesis 6
${H}_{0}$ 

${H}_{a}$ 

#### After running statistical test I feel confident these are drivers these will be my features.
